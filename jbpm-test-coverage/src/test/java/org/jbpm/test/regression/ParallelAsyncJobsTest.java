     * - Pending task scan interval = 1 second
     *
     * The process in this test will create 4 long running tasks (8 seconds) one after another. Then
     * the test will sleep for 4 seconds giving the JobExecutor time to pick up at least 2 tasks.
     *
     * The JobExecutor should be able to pick up all the tasks because one task takes 8 seconds to
     * complete and the scan interval is 1 second. On the other hand a task should not complete in
     * the 4 seconds so pending task count should not be lower than 3 if parallelism does not work.
